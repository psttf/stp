Simple Text Processor (or Scala Text Processor). This is an experiment on
combining [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) with
[Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/), [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) and
[Twirl templates](https://github.com/playframework/twirl) for text processing.

## Requirements

To run the project you will need:

* [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) installed
* `xelatex` command available from command line — you need to install a
  [TeX distributiuon](http://www.tug.org/interest.html#free)

## Running

To generate PDF output just execute

```
sbt run
```

You will need Internet access for sbt and LaTeX to load all the dependencies

## Why?

Although LaTeX is a great text processing tool with extensive library of
packages covering virtually any use case and an active community, writing your
own extensions and automations for LaTeX is usually a complicated task since TeX
was not intended to be a handy programming language.

Why do you need programming in LaTeX? Well, maybe for most kinds of text
documents you don't. But rich programming capabilities will be extremely useful
if you create something like a course material with a set of tasks, tests, exam 
variants and so on.

Our approach enables one to use Scala to create extensions and automations in a
simple, declarative, object-oriented, functional and type-safe way. Since we are
mostly dealing with string literals it is convinient to use a templating engine
— we use Twirl. To automate the build process and dependency management we use
sbt.

## How It Works

LaTeX file templates should be placed in [src/main/twirl](src/main/twirl). These
templates are compiled by Twirl.

PDF output is generated by running the project — i.e. by executing
[`Main.main`](src/main/scala/Main.scala#L10). First, TeX source files should be
produced from templates — this is done by calling

```
latex(tex.mytemplate)
```

It returns a `File` object for the generated file.

To generate the PDF output from a TeX source file you should apply `pdf` to this
file. The resulting file will be placed in `target/latex` folder. This is the
folder where generated TeX sources are stored and processed by `xelatex`.

Any static files (TeX sources, style files, images etc.) that do not need to be
preprocessed by Twirl should be placed in [src/main/static](src/main/static).

While executing `xelatex` command we filter out errors and warnings and log them
to the console. Filtering is done using
[regexes](src/main/scala/CLaTeXOutputFilter.scala) taken from
[TeXnicCenter sources](https://sourceforge.net/p/texniccenter/code/ci/default/tree/TeXnicCenter/LatexOutputFilter.cpp).
